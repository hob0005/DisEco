```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

This image captures the three corners of the epidemiological triad.is a model for researching health issues, particularly infectious diseases, by examining how th external conditions that either promote or prevent the spread of disease, the pathogen that causes the disease, and the organism that becomes infected. All three elements need to be present and interconnected for a disease to manifest.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59

\
2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios: \
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

the higher prevalence in B makes detection easier so a smaller sample size can be used

\
3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
prevalence \< 1 %. (5 points)
