Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.\

This image captures the three corners of the epidemiological triad.is a model for researching health issues, particularly infectious diseases, by examining how th external conditions that either promote or prevent the spread of disease, the pathogen that causes the disease, and the organism that becomes infected. All three elements need to be present and interconnected for a disease to manifest.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59

\
2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

the higher prevalence in B makes detection easier so a smaller sample size can be used

\
3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
prevalence \< 1 %. (5 points)

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence - case per period of time.\
(9 points)

6.12.25 - 5/51 per elk-day (0.098)

6.14.25 - 2/44 per elk-day (0.045)

6.15.25 - 0 per elk-day (no new cases)

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit\
for prevalence - percentages. (5 points)

6.13.25 - 12/56 prevalence of conjunctivitis (21.4%)

6.16.25 - 5/56 prevalence of conjunctivitis (8.9%)

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

6.10.25 1/56 are newly and currently infected

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)

6.15.25 and 6.16.25 (no new cases and cases recovered)

7.  The infection was caused by Pasteurella multocida because although it is harmless in antelopes' respiratory tractsm it became virulent due to tempurature and pressure which caused hemorrhagic septicemia. To prevent this in the future, disease surveillance can be implemented to monitor the health of species and environment and vaccination protocols and manage the habitat to ensure it is diverse and healthy to promote a strong immune system within animals
