7.  The infection was caused by Pasteurella multocida because although it is harmless in antelopes' respiratory tracts it became virulent due to tempurature and humidity which caused hemorrhagic septicemia. To prevent this in the future, disease surveillance can be implemented to monitor the health of species and environment and vaccination protocols and manage the habitat to ensure it is diverse and healthy to promote a strong immune system within animals

Tick Lab 

Identifying the tick's sex and life stage is the first step in the identifying process.  Finding the number of legs is the first step in determining the life stage, six legs indicate a larval stage, while eight legs indicate a nymph or adult stage.  If the tick has eight legs and a genital opening, you can tell if it is an adult.  Examine the tick's scutum to figure out its sex. Because an alloscutum suggests that the tick can engorge on a blood meal, it is indicative of a female tick.  Only female ticks feed on blood, as I discovered in the lab and lecture.  Finding the genus and species is the next step in basic tick identification.  Examine the anal groove's direction to identify the genus.  Anterior anal grooves are seen in the genus *Ixodes*, whilst posterior grooves are found in other genera.  The anal groove was made easier to recognize by the lab's clarification that all ticks have that half-circle structure beneath it. Next, identify the species by looking at the tick's mouth parts and pattern.  The last tick we examined was a lone-star tick using our lab key.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

**Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect,\
provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)**

\
1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. 

False. Although camels are the main reservoir host species for MERS-CoV, humans can contract the virus and spread it to other vulnerable people.

2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. 

True. MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that primarily infects camels in the Middle East, but it can also infect people.

3. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. 

False.mAlthough the virus can only finish brief infection chains, MERS-CoV can infect humans.  Although the disease can infiltrate the target population, it is unable to endure.

4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
65%. 

False. Only about 35% of human MERS infections have resulted in death, despite the case fatality rate for MERS-CoV may be greater due to underreporting or other factors.

5. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak.

False. A point source outbreak would be indicated by a single peak on the epidemic curve, showing an inflow of cases brought on by a single exposure event. However, following the initial exposure or influx of cases, the number of cases would gradually decline.  Although there is a noticeable decline in occurrences in this epidemic curve after 2020, we can observe a propagating source here where animals are infecting people and some humans are infecting other humans.

## 11.3.25 (#5)

1. This Marburg virus outbreak is an emerging infectious disease.  With accidental contact with the reservoir bats, the between-species transfer is .  Nonetheless, there is a comparatively high rate of within-species transmission among healthcare personnel or other individuals in exposed environments.  According to the community epidemiology paradigm created by Fenton and Pedersen, this dynamic fulfills the definition of a possible developing infectious illness.  The outbreak is not only spillover due to human-to-human transmission.  Humans are typically a dead end host in a spillover occurrence because the disease cannot persist for an extended period of time outside of the reservoir host species.

2. Isolation must be required for known Marburg cases.  For extremely likely suspected instances, seclusion may also be necessary.  Isolation does increase the danger of exposure and infection for medical staff and maybe other patients at connected facilities.  Strict personal protective equipment (PPE) regulations, negative pressure rooming, and disinfection and sterilization standards can all help reduce this exposure and infection.  Safe waste management, safe burial and body management, and caving certification or limits are some further concurrent risk-reduction strategies.

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting. (8 points)

The ecology of the Nipah virus differs throughout South and Southeast Asia. Pig bridge hosts are the primary means of transmission for the Nipah virus. Humans primarily contract the Nipah virus from infected pigs, whereas pigs can contract it via bats or fruit tainted with bat excrement. Both of these occur within Malaysia. However tainted date palm sap frequently infects people with the Nipah virus in Bangladesh. Bat excrement will contaminate the buckets used to gather sap, and eating raw sap can infect people. Since contact with infected pigs accounts for the majority of cases in Malaysia, early detection and surveillance of the disease is an important preventative approach given the observed mode of transmission. Because pigs are not involved, prevention in Bangladesh focuses on community-level exposure reduction and infection control, preventing bat contamination of date palm sap, and promoting safe caregiving practices in households and health facilities.

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. (6 points)

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can spread vertically from the mother or horizontally by fecal-oral transmission.  The majority of infections are believed to be caused by fecal-oral transfer, frequently as a result of vertical transmission.  The fecal-oral pathway is how a congenitally contaminated chick distributes the illness across a flock.  Overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and poor hygiene all contribute to fecal-oral transmission.  Fecal-oral transmission is further supported by the pathogen's resilience and persistence for weeks in the environment or on surfaces.

Commercial and wild hens, ARV results in arthritis and swollen tendons.  Joint swelling and inability to walk are symptoms.  ARV-caused ailments reduce or eliminate the ability for wild bird populations to forage for food or escape from predators.  While illness in commercial chickens can also be fatal due to decisions about treatment costs and product value, predation on sick wild birds is also fatal.


Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? (6 points)

Shrews are the reservoir for LayV, because of some surveillance tests of animals in the provinces of Shandong and Henan where cases were reported.  Shrews are common in the rural parts of China, and the majority of the cases involved farmers or frequent wildlife exposure. LayV is spread by direct or indirect contact with shrews and their body fluids. Since LayV has not been shown to spread from person to person, it is not considered an EID. Since the 2018–2022 outbreak, no new cases have been reported. LayV is a spillover because, although it can infect humans in addition to the reservoir animal, the virus has not been shown to be able to survive in other species.

There is a statistical difference between the raccoon roundworm prevalences in the three regions. The prevalence between the central region and the north region (p-value=0.0256) and the central region and the south region (p-value=0.0015) have significant difference, but there is no significant difference between the north and south (p-value=1). The quantity of raccoons and the persistence of raccoon roundworm eggs in the environment may have differences geographically. The central and southern regions might have more or better-established raccoon latrines. There may be geographical variations in raccoon density or in the presence and persistence of raccoon roundworm eggs in the environment.  

There was a significant difference between the prevalence of raccoon roundworm in females compared to males (p-value=0.0087). The prevalence within females was only significant in the south region (p-value=0.0030). There is also a significance between females and males in the central region (p-value=0.0859).  Females having a increased prevalence may suggest social or reproductive behavioral differences that put females in greater contact with contaminated environments or raccoon latrines.  

There was no significant difference in prevalence of raccoon roundworm in adults compared to young adults (p-value=0.2206). There was no significant difference for the prevalence of raccoon roundworm between ages within each region. This poses a need for more research on the differences in environment and population. The southern region has the biggest health risk and environmental risk to people specifically children and domestic animals

## 11.25.25 (#9)

In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection. 10 points

Compared to commercial poultry owners, backyard poultry owners have a closer attachment with their animals.  Owners of backyard poultry have more direct contact with the birds since they handle them or treat them as pets.  Increased direct contact raises the risk of infection because it is one method that germs like Salmonella enterica can be acquired. Owners of backyard chickens also allow kids to handle the birds which allows for more direct contact.  Children are likely to not practice proper sanitation techniques as well as the owners who might not be as educated on handling techniques.  Due to their weakened immune systems, children under five years old are more susceptible to infection. Owners of backyard chickens typically have less strict biosecurity protocols, irregular hygiene practices, and non-standard waste and litter control. Indirect touch is one way of transmission. Because there is a greater chance of bacteria being on fomites and infecting others who come into contact with those items, these behaviors put owners, kids, and neighbors at danger. Particles may get aerosolized when the litter is disturbed if diseases are shed into it. In situations with inadequate cleanliness, direct contact with bacteria-ridden eggs may potentially result in transmission. Owners of backyard chickens occasionally let their flocks roam freely. Because Salmonella enterica can linger in the environment, this may result in increasing exposure and infection.  In addition to free range movement, the previously mentioned poor management causes shedding into the environment, where soil or water bodies can become sources of exposure and infection for owners and nearby people.

What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? 3 points

Tall fescue grass is more resilient and tolerant in demanding settings when infected with the fungal endophyte.  Tall fescue is more resistant to drought and overgrazing with the fungal endophyte, and we noticed from photo in the presentation that infected grass seems greener and in better condition than non-infected grass.

What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points

Ergot alkaloids are normally produced by Epichloë coenophiala, however under stressful circumstances, the fungus generates more of them.  Temperature extremes, drought, excessive grazing, and low soil nitrogen levels are examples of stressors.  Through competing for soil nutrients or other unidentified mechanisms, the microbiome in the soil and surrounding tall fescue can also stress the plant and fungus.  The fungus produces more ergot alkaloids under these stressful conditions, which accumulate in the grass and make it more poisonous to grazing livestock.

What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 3 points

Weight loss, rough or discolored hair coats, decreased milk output, cardiovascular toxicity, and poor performance in cattle feeding on contaminated grass

## 11.25.25 (#10)

What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points

African Swine Fever can be transferred through a biological vector (soft ticks), direct touch (pig-to-pig through blood, saliva, or excrement), and indirect contact.  In carcasses and pig products, the virus can survive in the environment for months.  By serving as mechanical vectors, humans contribute to indirect transmission.  The virus spreads when people move contaminated items such as clothing, equipment, etc. between barns.  The spread of agriculture and pig farming as well as landscape fragmentation enhances wildlife contact with domestic pigs.  Other methods that humans spread the virus across farms and borders include tainted feeds, poor biosecurity, and the illicit meat trade.

Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points

As an acquired immunodeficiency virus, the Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is comparable to the human retrovirus HIV.  A koala is more susceptible to numerous illnesses and chlamydia because KoRV lowers the immune system.  Because their immune systems are weakened, koalas with co-infections with KoRV and chlamydia also have greater chlamydia symptoms, such as conjunctival, urinary, and respiratory diseases.  Infertility and death result from more severe symptoms and repeated or persistent chlamydia infections.  Co-infection raises koala death and infertility rates, which can affect population growth and species management.  The treatment of chlamydia may also be impacted by co-infection since the immune system may be compromised, making the use of antibiotics or the recently developed vaccine ineffective.   

Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.

What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 10 points

Testing accuracy with DNA tested for the fungus using qPCR, however when the presence is low for a particular snake, there are frequently false negatives. A false negative if the location that yielded a positive result had not been swabbed.The condition is seasonal because to snake brumation, making management challenging due to weakened immune systems and testing challenging due to low snake activity.Because natural populations are hard to sample, wild snake populations are challenging in and of themselves.  Since most snakes migrate via land and the fungal spores are tough to eradicate, the disease is extremely difficult to control due to the environmental persistence of the spores in soil.  Because snakes come into touch with boots, tools, and other items polluted by spore-infected soil, people also act as a mechanical vector for the distribution of the spores.

Disease Ecology Final

1. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (10 points)

a. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed
a spillover.
False, a spillover causine low between-species transmission and has low within-target species transmission

b. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.
False, a viral disease has to be transmitted by vectors to be infectious, but it is not contagious since it is not host to host. An infection from a vector to a human cannot be transmitted to another human

c. The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.
False, it can take about 2-4 weeks before the egg become infectious after excreted through feces by an infected raccoon

d. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.
True

e. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.
False, robins are considered superspreaders and northern cardinals are supersuppresors

2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have
these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)

The goal of community-based dracunculiasis prevention strategies is to disrupt important phases of the Guinea worm life cycle. The initial stage of transmission, the release of larvae into water, is prevented
by keeping affected people away from water sources. While larvicides applied to stagnant water kill copepods before the larvae reach the infectious stage, safe drinking water obtained through protected wells
and pipe filters prevents ingestion of copepods carrying infectious larvae. Strategies have grown to include active surveillance, tying affected animals to block access to water sources, and discouraging dogs
from eating potentially contaminated fish or fish entrails in response to the emergence of diseases in animals, especially dogs. Containment is further improved by community involvement, which includes reward
programs for reporting human and animal diseases. 

3. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in
managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

The lack of a vaccine or cure for CWD, a prion disease, restricts the resources available to stop its spread.  Because infected cervids can spread the illness asymptomatically and may not exhibit clinical
symptoms for extended periods of time, it is challenging to detect the disease early.  Logistical, financial, and sociopolitical limitations make management even more challenging because decision-making is
influenced by a variety of stakeholders, including government agencies, hunters, ranchers, and tribes.  Preventive methods include limiting baiting and feeding, outlawing cervid urine-based lures, and
forbidding the transportation of live cervids and carcasses, Increased hunting pressure, longer seasons, and the removal of targeted species after the season are examples of active management techniques that
involve non-selective harvesting in impacted areas.  Even with all of these initatives, not many have been implemented on a wide scale.

4. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with
Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:

5. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The
lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

a. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)
Francisella tularensis, subspecies holartica 

b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)
direct contact (animal, games meat, contaminated water and air) and vector-borne (ticks and deer flies)

c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health. (3 points)
Tularemia is classified as a Category A bioterrorism agent, despite no reports of human transmission. As one of the highest-priority pathogen for public health preparedness. It has a high infection rate, air
borne, and can be spread through vectors, multiple ways to be transmitted.

8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of ~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD.
Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance
approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)

1,351 hunter-harvested deer from a population of ~1 million is not a sufficient or accurate estimate of disease prevalence. When using the hypergeometric distribution to infer low
prevalence (e.g., 0.2%), it is not optimal. For example, for a population of 100,000 at 0.1% prevalence with 90% confidence, a sample size of 2,276 is required, suggesting that the Georgia sample may be too
small to detect very low levels of infection. The hypergeometric approach is that it assumes random sampling, which is barely achieved in hunter-harvested populations. The
diagnostic tests are not perfect and can produce false negatives. This can overestimate that CWD is absent, potentially underestimating the risk of undetected infections in the population.

9. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)

a. SARS-CoV-2 - True Multihost
Mainly in humans and some animal hosts, high transmission within- and between-species 

b. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - Spillover
humans are dead-end hosts, virus in rodent reservoir, low transmission within- and between-species transmission.

c. Langya Henipavirus - Spillover 
Identified in humans, low human-to-human transmission, spillover from animals

d. Brucellosis- Apparent Multihost
Humans are dead-end hosts, between-species transmission occurs with livestock to humans

e. West Nile virus - True Multihost
Birds and mosquitoes maintain transmission as main hosts, high transmission within- and between-species

10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a 
dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)

Definitive host: Marine mammals - larvae reach sexual maturity and reproduce
Dead-end host: Humans - larvae cannot mature or reproduce in our bodies
Paratenic host: Fish and cephalopod - transport the larvae to marine mammals when consumed and can inadvertently transmit the parasite to humans but no development occurs
Intermediate host: Crustaceans - ingest the larvae and serve as a necessary step and transfer parasite to fish, cephalopods, or directly to marine mammals

11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)

Not all infected hosts develop disease like meningeal worms do not cause disease in white-tailed deer but infections in elk can lead to severe disease and death. Some bats are infected with lyssaviruses, like rabies, remain asymptomatic. It depends on the hosts and the virus on whether symptoms will present.

12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should
be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)

1-1/R0
1-(1/2.5) = 0.6 = 60% of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (6 points)

Hosts and pathogens move freely across the environment which makes access and monitoring and control difficult. The interactions between hosts, pathogens, and the environment are not always understood which
plays into management. Raccoon rabies in the eastern U.S. is difficult to control because raccoons live almost everywhere and the virus can infect multiple host species including humans, and vaccinating the
entire population is not feasible or realistic. Oral bait vaccines have helped control rabies in Appalachia, vaccines ares usually unavailable for most wildlife diseases which makes it hard to manage. White
nose syndrome in bat is also hard to manage because of remote cave habitats, and CWD is difficult to detect because of its long incubation period and asymptomatic carriers.
Wildlife diseases are often multi-host as well. Canine rabies in Africa transmits between jackals and domestic dogs, creating risks for humans and control is harder. Disease outcome also depend on host
susceptibility and environmental conditions. For instance, Saiga antelope experience mass mortality events when stressed during crowded calving periods in warm, humid conditions and the normally harmless
bacterium Pasteurella multocida becomes lethal. Sociopolitical factors limit effective management. For CWD, interventions involve hunters, deer farms, and regulatory agencies, and balancing economic,
recreational, and conservation interests have a great influence in how they are managed.
