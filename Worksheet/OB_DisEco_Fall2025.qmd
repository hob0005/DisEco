Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.

cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

7.  The infection was caused by Pasteurella multocida because although it is harmless in antelopes' respiratory tracts it became virulent due to tempurature and humidity which caused hemorrhagic septicemia. To prevent this in the future, disease surveillance can be implemented to monitor the health of species and environment and vaccination protocols and manage the habitat to ensure it is diverse and healthy to promote a strong immune system within animals

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\

2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

**Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect,\
provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)**

\
1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. 

False. Although camels are the main reservoir host species for MERS-CoV, humans can contract the virus and spread it to other vulnerable people.

2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. 

True. MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that primarily infects camels in the Middle East, but it can also infect people.

3. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. 

False.mAlthough the virus can only finish brief infection chains, MERS-CoV can infect humans.  Although the disease can infiltrate the target population, it is unable to endure.

4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
65%. 

False. Only about 35% of human MERS infections have resulted in death, despite the case fatality rate for MERS-CoV may be greater due to underreporting or other factors.

5. The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak.

False. A point source outbreak would be indicated by a single peak on the epidemic curve, showing an inflow of cases brought on by a single exposure event. However, following the initial exposure or influx of cases, the number of cases would gradually decline.  Although there is a noticeable decline in occurrences in this epidemic curve after 2020, we can observe a propagating source here where animals are infecting people and some humans are infecting other humans.


1. This Marburg virus outbreak is an emerging infectious disease.  With accidental contact with the reservoir bats, the between-species transfer is .  Nonetheless, there is a comparatively high rate of within-species transmission among healthcare personnel or other individuals in exposed environments.  According to the community epidemiology paradigm created by Fenton and Pedersen, this dynamic fulfills the definition of a possible developing infectious illness.  The outbreak is not only spillover due to human-to-human transmission.  Humans are typically a dead end host in a spillover occurrence because the disease cannot persist for an extended period of time outside of the reservoir host species.

2. Isolation must be required for known Marburg cases.  For extremely likely suspected instances, seclusion may also be necessary.  Isolation does increase the danger of exposure and infection for medical staff and maybe other patients at connected facilities.  Strict personal protective equipment (PPE) regulations, negative pressure rooming, and disinfection and sterilization standards can all help reduce this exposure and infection.  Safe waste management, safe burial and body management, and caving certification or limits are some further concurrent risk-reduction strategies.
